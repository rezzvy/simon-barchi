# Simon Barchi

## Overview

Simon Barchi is a web-based Simon game with a Blue Archive theme.

- Blue archive themes, characters, voices
- Stage feature
- and more to explore

## How it Works

This game works like Simon, where the player follows a random sequence.

- The game creates a random color sequence and stores it in an array.
- It plays the sequence using recursion.
- The player repeats it. The game checks if the clicked button matches the current color in the sequence. A variable called "playerMoveLength" is used as an index to track which color the player needs to guess correctly.
- If the player is correct, they continue. If not, the game ends and shows the result.

## How to Use

Assuming you've forked the repo and are running a local server or using the demo app:

1. Click the "Start Game" button.
2. The sequence will play, watch it carefully.
3. Once it's done, repeat the sequence correctly.
4. Continue repeating the sequence until you make a mistake, which will end the game.
